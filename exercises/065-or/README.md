# `065` or

In this exercise, we are going to replicate the behavior of the OR operator `||` without actually using the operator itself. Do you remember how it works?

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `or`. Given 2 boolean expressions, `or` returns true or false, following the rules of the `||` operator.

## 📎 Example:

```Javascript
let output = or(true, false);
console.log(output); // --> true;
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ Don't use the `||` operator. 

+ Use `!` and `&&` operators instead.
